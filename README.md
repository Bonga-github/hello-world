Ideas, resources and chats!
My name is Bonga and I like writing. I've written a lot of books, stories, poetry, and even blogs over the years, and shockingly, I've managed to make it a career. Currently, I am trying to branch out and see what I am capable of, and that's why I am doing this coding bootcamp with Umuzi :).
